## Introduction

Four Quartets Genius is a web app modeled off of the popular [Genius](https://genius.com/) site, but built specifically for T.S. Eliot's magisterial set of poems  _Four Quartets_. The poem is notoriously obscure and users will enjoy learning from commentary posted by others. If they are so inclined, users can sign up and comment on their favorite lines of the poem as well. The app is built using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Redux, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. 

## Using the app
Clone the repository to your local machine and `npm install` on your command line. To get the database going `npm run seed`. Then, to get the app going on localhost, `npm run start-dev`.
